" Firmness, Feel & Comfort of the Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium ","The Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium is about a 5 on a 1-10 firmness scale (which makes it ideal for people that lay in all 3 sleep positions at night; i.e. back, stomach & side). if you know you for a fact that you prefer a VERY soft (i.e. a 3-4 out of 10) or a VERY firm (i.e. a 7-9 out of 10) mattress.", Construction & Design of the Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium ,"The Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium has innerspring pocket coils for support & a gel memory foam comfort layer.Additionally, the tight-top does a good job adequately supporting your weight, providing a relatively wide sleep surface (+ 'decent' edge support).The pillow-top + hybrid innerspring combination is a relatively standard mattress design in 2022 for a reason. Even in older, potentially discontinued models like this one. The style is tried & true, even if material & construction quality is considered slightly 'lesser' than more premium builds (like a Saatva or Winkbed).", Support & Motion Isolation of the Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium ,Support & motion isolation for Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium is fair (nothing exceptional).The bottom innerspring pocket coils combined with the gel memory foam do a fine job dissipating motion transfer across the mattress.It's safe to say the beautyrest 12 silver brs900 medium mattress is likely built to last 3-5+ years (before it's time to replace it). This is one of the main reasons why it's difficult to recommend this mattress., Breathability & Heat Transfer For Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium ,"The Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium uses cooling tech in both their top cover and construction. Typically, proprietary names for normal features are fancy marketing techniques to make a specific characteristic appear better than it might be.We recommend considering 2 primary factors with your potential future mattress's cooling: (1) does MODEL have decent airflow and (2) does the top cover and construction wick moisture & dissipate heat? If those 2 benefits don't exist, heat created by your body at night can get trapped into small temperature pockets inside the top layer of the mattress (because of (a) poor airflow and (b) rising heat). The result? A potential loss of REM sleep. Losing REM sleep carries a whole host of other negative health consequences (way too many to list here).In the case of Brs900, there's a chance small heat pockets like this could form. It's exceedingly difficult to compare mattress models and technologies, so we usually recommend either: (1) calling Beautyrest directly to confirm specific features of technologies, or (2) consider a luxury online mattress company (almost always a better option). In the case of #2, we strongly recommend taking a look at Saatva.", Eco-Friendliness For Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium ,"The Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium is not an organic mattress. Eco-friendly? Maybe. It's difficult to measure because eco-friendliness is a very subjective (and often-times personal) assessment. If eco-friendliness is your primary concern, we recommend considering e-commerce brands with much less potential physical footprint (since they have few-to-no physical stores).The most comparable 100% organic brand we feel comfortable recommending is Zenhaven. Zenhaven is a 100% talalay latex mattress that's flippable and built unusually well for it's price point.Check Zenhaven out, here.)", Availability of the Beautyrest 12 Silver Brs900 Medium ,"This specific Beautyrest model, like many, are hard to find online. Availability is unreliable at best.Large established brands usually release dozens of models (then stop producing them).
